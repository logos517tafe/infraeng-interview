The core of ASX infrastucture cloud automation is based on terraform.

The "main.tf" file shows a small incomplete fragment of terraform code.  Using this code as a basis, do the following:

1. Add comments to the main.tf file to explain what code of the "dynamic" section is doing and how it operates.

2. The input.tf file specifies a variable "instances", but this does not match the code.  Using this input variable, modify the resource to do the following:
  a) create a set of VM instances from the map supplied by the "instances" variable
  b) Set the resource name from the map keys
  c) Set the resource machine_type, zone and description from the properties of the map values
  d) Set the hostname to a value generated by the instance name and the zone, seperated by a hyphen, with a DNS suffix i.e "hostname-zone.asx.com.au"

3. Create an output.tf file that would provide an output made up of the list of VM hostnames as a map, keyed by the instance name
4. Bonus - extend the output to output the IP addresses assigned to each instance, keyed by instance FQDN
